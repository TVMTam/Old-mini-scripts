## Forewords
This repo contains my old scripts back when I start learning how to code in Python. I practice my skills on Project Euler and PracticePython websites.

you should find these scripts in their respective folders.

check out [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) and [Practice Python](https://www.practicepython.org/).
