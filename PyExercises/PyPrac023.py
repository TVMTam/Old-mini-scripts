"""http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/12/14/23-file-overlap.html
Given two .txt files that have lists of numbers in them, find the numbers that are overlapping. "Ex_23_primenumbers.txt" file has a list of all prime numbers under 1000, and the "Ex_23_happynumbers.txt" file has a list of happy numbers up to 1000.

(If you forgot, prime numbers are numbers that canâ€™t be divided by any other number. And yes, happy numbers are a real thing in mathematics - you can look it up on Wikipedia. The explanation is easier with an example, which I will describe below.)"""
